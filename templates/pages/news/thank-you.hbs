Wow, what an amazing few days we had last week. 210 people, x tacos, x burgers, 8 kilos of bananas, 5000 coffees, 200 tees, and a whole lotta orange!

To everyone whom bought a ticket and came along on the day, thank you! Never did we think we'd get such a great turnout. It felt like a very special mix of creative coder types, and almost all from Australia or surrounding countries, many whom we'd never have met otherwise. This event was for you, and we hope you enjoyed every minute!

A big thank you to our speakers whom put their love, sweat, tears and experience into sharing their inspiring work, stories and ideas. [Nicole](https://twitter.com/stubbornella), [Chris Wright](https://twitter.com/cwrightdesign), [Nicolas](https://twitter.com/necolas, [Connor](https://twitter.com/connors), [Ana](https://twitter.com/thebabydino), [Chris Giffard](https://twitter.com/cgiffard), [Lea](https://twitter.com/leaverou), [Simurai](https://twitter.com/simurai) and [Chris Eppstein](https://twitter.com/chriseppstein). We didn't even ask what they were going to talk about, because we knew they'd all be great. And they were! Thank you so much for your support.

Also a big thank you to the x people who submitted a talk proposal but ultimately weren't selected. It takes time, energy and courage to submit a proposal, and it killed us to have to choose only a couple. A massive thank you to all of you!

To the friends and volunteers who put up their hand to help, and who, without clear direction or preparation, all came together to make the day not only hitch-free but to exceed everyone’s expectations. Thank you!

To the Decompress crew: [Mark Dalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish) and [Paul Taggell](https://twitter.com/tagell). Paul contacted us from the start and asked if he and Melbourne Uni could help in any way. We then asked Mark if he could put his MelbJS know-how and awesome-one-pager-site skills to good use and create, organise and run a side-event. A cross between a [Jelly](http://workatjelly.com/), a meetup, and a Railscamp. And what transpired was absolutely perfect. Thank you to you both, as well as those who volunteered on the day.

Fourthly, to our sponsors. We were lucky enough to have amazing companies approach us, and be patient whilst we prepared our sponsorship package and put together the details. A massive thank you to the individuals at those companies that saw a mutually beneficial opportunity, and to help make that happen. Without you, the event wouldn’t have happened.

And lastly, to the people that worked alongside us providing their skills and services: [Everyday Coffee](http://www.everyday-coffee.com/) for the amazing coffee and sweets; [Taco Truck](http://www.thetacotruck.com/), [Beatbox Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Beatbox-Kitchen/108806049145877), [Banh Mi Boys](http://www.banhmiboys.com.au/) for the delicious food; [Arts House Melbourne](http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/artshouse/) and City of Melbourne for the gorgeous heritage listed venue; [Carla Hackett](http://carlahackett.com/) for the lettering, illustration, signage, and tees; [SC&amp;F](http://www.scafplasticfabrication.com.au/) for the CSSConf stage sign; [Hilary Walker](http://hilarywalker.com.au/) for the photography; and [PSI Screen Printing](http://www.psionline.com.au/) for the tees.

We're busily preparing the videos of all the talks, which should start going up later this week for everyone to see. But for now, we just wanted to say thank you.

From the entire CSSConf crew, thank you for an amazing few days which we'll never forget.
