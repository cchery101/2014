The team at CSSConf are all so so thrilled to announce our next speaker, Tab Atkins Jr.

You've almost certainly directly benefitted by the amazing work that he's done. Tab works for Google, and is a CSS working group member â€” he's a badass hacker, who works on CSS specifications and this truly places him firmly in my list of internet heroes.

Because Tab uses and understands the web, has access to chrome engineers and feels our CSS pains on the regular, he's writing really interesting and insightful specifications.

If you're interested in how the standards process works, the (general) future of CSS, or want to talk about the parent selector with someone who definiately knows a lot more than you ever will; Tab is your man.

Don't miss him. Get your ticket today!
